# Javascript Review: Review Session 2
---
This past week, we looked at Javascript, we looked at NodeJS, and we developed a Jukebox app.  

Let's take what we've learned and apply it to what we know about OOP. That is, let's translate our Pacman, Ghost and Ball classes from [Ruby](https://github.com/ogryzek/oop_review) into Javascript.

## Ball class
Our `Ball` class should have a `ball_type` attribute whose value can either be regular or super,
```Javascript
// ball.js
```
